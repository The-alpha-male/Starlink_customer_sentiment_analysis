19,i would like to say that the process of setting up the standing course a bit challenging specially it requires a clear view of the sky so if you you need to ensure that there is they are no obstructions at all yeah but after it was uh setup it works great and considering mine has an obstruction on the western side it work great

25,got my kit in 24 hours and worked perfectly
26,"i just realized that there is not coverage for my area, which i am surprised i wonder why this information is not provided in the product description since i ended up with an expensive device i can not even activate even after struggling with the headache of activating it, when you go to starlink website, there is no contacts for customer support for one to reach out to get the appropriate support also at the base of the starlink dish where it fits into the stand, there were some marksi suspect the product was used and somebody returned it"

48,pure greatness
49,working perfectly fine
50,"works perfectly, it is just super, internet speed is superfast and no buffering, i use it in an urban area surrounded by buildings and if you intend to do the same, just ensure you have a clear view of the sky without any obstruction on the south side as the dish is pointing in that direction, thank you starlink for giving us a wonderful product and thank you jumia for making it available in kenya"
51,so far i have tested the product and it is working well i am waiting to see how the rest of the daysmonths it is going to behave
52,took a bit of setting up as would not activate easily but a few emails back and forth to starlink and all sorted and amazing internet speeds in the bush

54,works perfectly like promised

57,quick service
58,as long as it has a clear line of sight with the sky you will never be disappointed
59,real and quick
60,it was delivered on time
61,activation and payment modalities clarity is still a nightmare given it is in a new market
62,great internet
63,it worked for a few minutes then just randomly stopped working after contacting starlink support they sent out a new cable but that still had not changed anything the dish appeared to have been used and damaged i do not know
64,the internet is more reliable than big local providers no regrets the routers wifi signal is not as strong you might need a wifi extender or ethernet adapter if you have a bigger compound
65,"this is the best isp in kenya price to performance wise installation is simple the kit is actually new rather than refurbished as people claim effects on weather is so minimal you will not notice it my only gripe is that the wifi signal on both 24 and 5ghz is pretty weak
average speeds is about 80 mbps and peak i have got is 260 mbps"
66,speed i have not have any problem since day one either stream or gaming
67,"it was easy to install and set up i have better internet connection than before, and even though cables are down i am able to hold zoom meetings well"
68,greatness
69,it is very fast and efficient
70,product seemed to have been opened as if it is a second hand product and it is not even connecting even after i placed it in a clear sky

73,very easy setup just needs good sky coverage

75,"despite my best efforts calling the customer call centre and requesting for an etr invoice, i ended up placing and completing my order without the etr because it was taking too long and the call centre staff sounded unsure on what process to follow to get an etr"

80,the internet speeds are just amazing
81,as expected
82,latency too high
83,fast internet speeds
84,strong signal and fast speeds
85,"the product arrived on time but i noticed jumia cannot support you contact the seller when the product has an issue i was forced to engage starlink myself and you can only write to them funny enough is you get one response in every 24hrs the simple issue of set up took several days to be resolved for the internet itself, upload speed are always and unbalanced compared to
download once the latency which is crucial is always above 100 i have also experienced downtime even though it is mounted to a high point with no obstruction if you are in a place with safaricom home or fibre home, those are better option than this if you are in a remote place with no any other means, this can help"
86,"the kit as delivered requires an additional adapter to be integrated into an existing network mounts sold on jumia do not work, buy directly from starlink who deliver quickly speeds vary from 50mbs to 140mbs, but that depends on time of day and line of sight upload speeds are around 1520mbs slower upload speeds can be a problem if several people are online on calls"
87,stable and fast speeds
88,speed is amazing
89,i got my starlink kit on jumia and i am so happy with the quality of the internet way better and overall cheaper than safaricom
